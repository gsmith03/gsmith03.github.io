    <!-- Section 5: About Me -->

      <h2 align="center">About Me</h2>
      <br>
      <h3>School</h3>
      <p class="aboutme">
      I am a Computer Science student at Kennesaw State University. I also have a Bachelor's in Psychology with
      a minor in Communication, which has given me a deeper understanding of human behavior and effective interaction.
      Before starting school at Kennesaw State, I completed a programming bootcamp with NuCamp.
      The bootcamp gave me a great foundation, but being new to this industry, it also left a lot of questions.
      Overall, it created a desire to learn more about Computer Science, particularly data structures and algorithms.
      I was also able to gain a better understanding of object-oriented programming.
      This field fascinates me with its endless possibilities and rapid advancements.
      </p>
      <br>

      <h3>Work Experiences</h3>
      <p class="aboutme">
        Before school and bootcamp, I worked in various types of customer service.
        I learned how to communicate effectively, display empathy for individual situations, and
        the importance of creating excellent customer experiences. I also served in the military where I
        learned problem-solving, team-building, and adaptability skills. I was taught values like integrity,
        self-discipline, resilience, and time management. That experience was incredibly enriching, allowing me to
        meet people from diverse backgrounds and adapt to different environments.
      </p>
      <br>

      <h3>Personal Time</h3>
      <p class="aboutme">
        Currently, I'm not working professionally, choosing instead to dedicate my time to strengthening my skills
        and knowledge in computer science.
        When not immersed in my studies, I'm usually on the go, chasing after my
        two toddlers, who seem to have unlimited energy.
        Being a parent has taught me patience, improved my multitasking,
        and reinforced the importance of a good sense of humor.
        I'm passionate about learning and constantly seek new
        challenges that push me to grow personally and professionally.
        In my free time, I love exploring the latest
        tech trends, reading psychological thrillers, and finding new and creative ways to engage my children.
      </p>
      <br>

      <p class="aboutme"> Life is busy, but I wouldn't have it any other way! </p>
